Here is the full mathematical model as well as the simulation anad analysis code for `tritopatch` that is maintained by 
Damie Pak (postdoc at Tad Dallas Lab at the University of South Carolina).



## Mathematical model
If you are solely interested in the mathematical formulation - 
`discrete_trito_model.R` describes the entire local process. 

## Calculating R-effective calculator
I tried to make it more generalizable, but at this point is built into the
model.
