This is the full code and analysis for `tritonet` that is maintained by 
Damie Pak.


Quick note:

## Simulating spatial network
The simulation of the spatial network has its own script.

## Mathematical model
If you are solely interested in the mathematical formulation - 
`discrete_trito_model.R` describes the entire local process as well
as the incoming dispersal mode.

## Calculating R-effective calculator
Tried to make it more generalizable, but at this point is built into the
model.
